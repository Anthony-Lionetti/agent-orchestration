# Initial Thoughts

## Agent Type Management

- **Agent type registry**: Map agent types to their assigned queues (`data_processor_agent` → `data_processing_queue`)
- **Agent spawning**: Start worker agents based on queue activity
- **Agent termination**: Clean shutdown when queues are empty or on system stop

## Queue-Based Routing

- **Queue monitoring**: Track depth/activity of different queues
- **Agent-queue binding**: Ensure each agent type only consumes from its designated queue(s)
- **Dynamic scaling**: Spawn more agents of a type when its queue gets backlogged

## Worker Agent Lifecycle

- **Agent startup**: Initialize worker agent with proper queue binding
- **Agent health**: Monitor if worker agents are responsive/processing
- **Agent cleanup**: Graceful shutdown, letting agents finish current tasks

## Orchestrator Interface

- **Command processing**: Handle orchestrator commands to start/stop/scale specific agent types
- **Status reporting**: Report back to orchestrator about worker agent states
- **Error propagation**: Notify orchestrator when worker agents fail

## Simple Architecture:

```
Orchestrator Agent → [Queue A,   Queue B,      Queue C]
                          ↓          ↓             ↓
ConsumerService → [Agent Type 1, Agent Type 2, Agent Type 3]
```

**Key insight**: Each worker agent type is essentially a specialized consumer with its own message processing logic, but they all use your `Consumer` class under the hood.
